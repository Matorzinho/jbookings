# jbookings
_Jenny's bookings_

Experimental project created for learning purposes.

#### It uses:
  * [Express](https://expressjs.com/) as a server, 
  * [Materialize framework](http://materializecss.com/) for the frontend 
  * [MySql database](https://www.mysql.com/) for persisting data.

_This was hosted on AWS under the URL: http://dougbacelar.com/jbookings. I took it down to prevent recurring billings._
